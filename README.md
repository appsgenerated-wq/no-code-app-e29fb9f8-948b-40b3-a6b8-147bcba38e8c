# FlavorFleet - Food App

Welcome to FlavorFleet, a restaurant browsing and management application built entirely with React and Manifest.

This project demonstrates a full-stack application where the backend is 100% powered by Manifest, handling the database, API, authentication, and access control. The frontend is a modern React application using the official `@mnfst/sdk` for all backend interactions.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Customers and Restaurant Owners can sign up and log in.
- **Restaurant Listings**: Publicly browse all restaurants.
- **Restaurant Management**: Owners can create and manage their restaurant details and menu items.
- **Role-Based Permissions**: Strict access control using Manifest policies ensures users can only modify their own data.
- **Direct Backend Interaction**: No custom API services or context providers; the app communicates directly with the Manifest backend via the SDK.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- npm or yarn

A running Manifest backend instance is required. This is automatically provisioned when deploying through the Manifest platform.

### Installation & Running

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Admin Panel

A full-featured admin panel is automatically generated by Manifest. You can access it to manage all users, restaurants, menu items, and other data.

- **URL**: `${BACKEND_URL}/admin`
- **Default Login**: `admin@manifest.build` / `admin`

## Demo Users

You can use these credentials on the landing page to test the application:

- **Restaurant Owner**: `owner@demo.com` / `password`
- **Customer**: `customer@demo.com` / `password`
